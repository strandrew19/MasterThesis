# Master Thesis

This Repository contains code for my Masters Thesis, "Modeling disinformation with spatial modeling" for Universit√§t Trier. The dataset used in the Master Thesis is avalible in an obfuscated format due to data protection rules and Terms of Service from Twitter.

Special Thanks to https://github.com/Altimis for the open source package Scweet. A forked version of the repository is avalible under https://github.com/strandrew19/Scweet which extends the functionality of the package with the function get_retweeters to grab all individuals that have retweeted a particular tweet. 

<details><summary>Using get_retweeters from strandrew19/Scweet</summary>
<p>
  
To enable the get_retweeters function, ensure that the .env variable has been set to enable logins for twitter scraping (instructions are avalible under the github repo)

get_retweeters has been modeled after get_users_following, get_users_followers and thus all variables are comparable except for the addition of tweets. 

To invoke get_retweeters using the example below:

tweets_dict = {'TwitterUsername':['Number corresponding to tweet']}
test = get_retweeters(list(tweets_dict.keys()), tweets_dict, env_path, headless=False, file_path=repo)

The values of the dictionary correspond to the tweet number that comes immediately after the status.

Remeber to set file_path variable as well to ensure the file will be written out (in json format)
